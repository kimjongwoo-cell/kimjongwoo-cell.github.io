Hello, I’m Jongwoo Kim, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at KAIST, advised by [Prof. Mun Yong Yi](https://sites.google.com/view/myyi-kaist). I’m currently engaged in research activities alongside my great colleagues at the [Knowledge Innovation Research Center (KIRC)](https://kirc.kaist.ac.kr).

My research focuses on building practical AI systems for real-world applications, particularly in education, healthcare, and recommendation. Recently, I’ve become especially interested in foundation models, exploring how Graph Language Models (GLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can be integrated with diverse modalities to improve multimodal reasoning and understanding.
