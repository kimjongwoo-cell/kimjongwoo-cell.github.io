Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Ph.D. student in Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research interest is mainly on anything connected to or can be represented as graphs!

- Recommendation
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Chemistry and Biology
- General Machine Learning and Data Mining
